<!--
	This is the file for user defined recipes for the cutting table
	
	This will not be overwritten every game launch and can be used to both overwrite the 
		existing recipes and add your own to the cutting table.
		
	If you want to override the existing recipe in the game simply include a recipe
		with the same name here.
		
	Recipes can be completely blank if you wish to simply remove the recipe
	
	Including the following recipe will prevent the recipe in the core file from being 
		registered and will not leave one in its place
	<recipe name="Plank">
	</recipe>
	
	Restrictions/guidelines:
	
	The tool tag must be filled with a number from 0 to 3
 		0 for knife, 1 for axe, 2 for pickaxe, 3 for shovel
	There can only be one input currently, support for other tools may be added in the future
	There can also only be 4 outputs, any others will be ignored
	
	"modID" is the id of the mod, not the name, the mcmod.info file will give this 
		as will the "Mods" menu. This is a needed attribute.
	"itemName" is the gameregistry name that the item is registered with, there is a 
		public list of minecraft's names and some helpful mods make theres public
	"number" is optional and will have no affect if used in the stack for an input
		it defaults to one of it is not specified
	"itemMeta" is optional and will default to 0 if not specified
		eg - if you want to use just birch planks it needs to be 2
	
	sample recipe would be: 

	<recipe name="MinecraftLog0">
		<tool>1</tool>
		<input>
			<itemStack modID="minecraft" itemName="log" itemMeta="0"/>
		</input>
		<outputs>
			<itemStack modID="minecraft" itemName="planks" number="5" itemMeta="0"/>
		</outputs>
	</recipe>
