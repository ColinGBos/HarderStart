Some potential ideas for the gem's worldgen:

They will spawn in large geodes - roundish rooms with hollow centers
The gems will spawn either as ores or crystals on the floor of the geode.

I have 25 different gems - for the different enchantments - I like having this many
Not sure if there should be the same number of gem rocks though...
