Playing Minecraft with the mod:

First steps:
you start off the world with the ability to do very little, punch leaves to get sticks, search ground for flint. 

First tools are flint for the "sharp" ones, namely a rudimentary hatchet - weapon and cutting capabilities, also a flint hoe/shovel combo
You will also be able to make your first stone mallet out of a rock that you find in the world and a stick and some string/twine

Because these tools will have such low durabilities you will be encouraged to do some real caveing before just settling down in a hole. 
I also potentially want to make it so that if you punch dirt with anything besides a shovel it drops partial dirt, an item that can't actually
be placed into the world. If you want to make a shelter you need to craft a block to place into the world.
