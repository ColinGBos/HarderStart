It would be really cool to have the processing of ores doen in the world instead of in machines and such
For instance the ore you get or rubble would need to be placed inside a multiblock smeltery style settup and then gets turned into something else as a result
	the ability to process certain metals would need to be related to their actual melting points, likely rounded to five tiers
	This would provide the ability to control progression through the tiers of metals and allow you to implement other tiers of iron and alloys
	
The player would be forced to pick blocks up in world and keep track of the smeltery but it would provide more 
	gameplay than simple set and forget stack processing all-encompassing furnaces with no tiers.
